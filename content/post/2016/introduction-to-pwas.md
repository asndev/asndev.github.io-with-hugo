## Devs Meetup Talk in Freiburg

Progressive Web Applications take advantage of new technologies 
(Service Worker, App Shell, App Manifest, Push notifications) to improve the user experience of mobile websites.
Their goal is to be reliable, fast, and engaging. 

In this talk we explained the goal and the architecture of a progressive web app and illustrated how to make an existing application progressive.
